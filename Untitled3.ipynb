        "\n",

        "the private life of waiters, though I have been in the club for twenty\n",
        "years. I was even unaware whether they slept down-stairs or had their\n",
        "own homes, nor had I the interest to inquire of other members, nor they\n",
        "the knowledge to inform me. I hold that this sort of people should be\n",

        "subscribe yearly, I believe, for these purposes; but to come into\n",
        "closer relation with waiters is bad form; they are club fittings, and\n",
        "William should have kept his distress to himself or taken it away and\n",
        "patched it up, like a rent in one of the chairs. His inconsiderateness\n",
        "has been a pair of spectacles to me for months.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is not correct taste to know the name of a club-waiter, so that I\n",
        "must apologize for knowing William's and still more for not forgetting\n",
        "it. If, again, to speak of a waiter is bad form, to speak bitterly is\n",
        "the comic degree of it. But William has disappointed me sorely. There\n",
        "were years when I would defer dining several minutes that he might wait\n",
        "on me. His pains to reserve the window-seat for me were perfectly\n",
        "satisfactory. I allowed him privileges, as to suggest dishes, and would\n",
        "give him information, as that someone had startled me in the\n",
        "reading-room by slamming a door. I have shown him how I cut my finger\n",
        "with a piece of string. Obviously he was gratified by these attentions,\n",
        "usually recommending a liqueur; and I fancy he must have understood my\n",
        "sufferings, for he often looked ill himself. Probably he was rheumatic,\n",
        "but I cannot say for certain, as I never thought of asking, and he had\n",

        "guilty of such effrontery. In appearance, of course, he is mean, but I\n",
        "can no more describe him than a milkmaid could draw cows. I suppose we\n",
        "distinguish one waiter from another much as we pick our hat from the\n",

        "\n",
        "\"How?\" snorted his mother. \"Dogs! Dogs ain't nothing but foolishness.\n",

        "After more parley and many warnings the arrangement was completed. Miss\n",
        "Bailey was intrusted with two dollars and ten cents, and the censorship\n",
        "of Morris. A day or so later Mrs. Mowgelewsky retired, indomitable, to\n",
        "her darkened room in the hospital, and the neighbors were inexorably\n",
        "shut out of her apartment. All their offers of help, all their proffers\n",
        "of advice were politely refused by Morris, all their questions and\n",
        "visits politely dodged. And every morning Miss Bailey handed her\n",
        "Monitor of the Goldfish Bowl his princely stipend, adding to it from\n",
        "time to time some fruit or other uncontaminated food, for Morris was\n",
        "religiously the strictest of the strict, and could have given cards and\n",

        "\n",
        "The Saturday after his mother's departure Morris spent in the\n",

        "longer roved farther than his own back yard, and who accepted Morris's\n",
        "frank admiration with a noble condescension and a few rheumatic\n",
        "gambols. Miss Bailey's mother was also hospitable, and her sister did\n",
        "what she could to amuse the quaint little child with the big eyes, the\n",
        "soft voice, and the pretty foreign manners. But Morris preferred Rover\n",
        "to any of them, except perhaps the cook, who allowed him to prepare a\n",
        "luncheon for himself after his own little rites.\n",
        "\n",
        "Everything had seemed so pleasant and so successful that Miss Bailey\n",

        "greatly surprised on the succeeding Friday afternoon when the Monitor\n",

        "very neat and clean and most properly set out. A little lamp was\n",
        "burning clearly. Morris's hair was parted for about an inch back from\n",
        "his forehead and sleeked wetly down upon his brow. The guest had\n",
        "evidently undergone similar preparation for the meal. Each had a napkin\n",
        "tied around his neck, and as Teacher watched them, Morris carefully\n",
        "prepared his guest's dinner, while the guest, an Irish terrier, with\n",
        "quick eyes and one down-flopped ear, accepted his admonishings with a\n",

        "feet.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Oh! Teacher! Teacher!\" cried Morris, half in dismay at discovery, and\n",

        "appreciate his friend. \"Oh! Teacher! Missis Bailey! this is the friend\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Oh, is his name Izzie?\" asked Miss Bailey, grasping at this\n",

        "presenting to her. \"And this is the friend you told me about? You let\n",

        "\n",
        "\"I had a 'fraid,\" said the Monitor of the Gold Fish Bowl frankly.\n",

        "\n",
        "He refused to entertain any plan which would separate him immediately\n",
        "from Izzie, but he was at last brought to see the sweet reasonableness\n",
        "of preparing his mother's mind by degrees to accept another member to\n",
        "the family.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Und he eats,\" his protector was forced to admit--\"he eats somethin'\n",
        "fierce, Missis Bailey; as much like a man he eats. Und my mamma, I\n",
        "don't know what she will say. She won't leave me I shall keep him; from\n",
        "long I had a little bit of a dog, und she wouldn't to leave me I should\n",

        "\n",
        "\"And _I_ can't very well keep him,\" said Miss Bailey sadly, \"because,\n",
        "you see, there is Rover. Rover mightn't like it. But there is one thing\n",
        "I can do: I'll keep him for a few days when your mother comes back, and\n",
        "then we'll see, you and I, if we can persuade her to let you have him\n",
        "always.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"She wouldn't never to do it,\" said Morris sadly. \"That other dog,\n",
        "didn't I told you how he didn't eat so much like Izzie, and she\n",
        "wouldn't to let me have him? That's a cinch.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Oh! don't say that word, dear,\" cried Teacher. \"And we can only try.\n",

        "\n",
        "This guilty secret had a very dampening effect upon the joy with which\n",
        "Morris watched for his mother's recovery. Upon the day set for her\n",
        "return, he was a miserable battle-field of love and duty. Early in the\n",
        "morning Izzie had been transferred to Miss Bailey's yard. Rover was\n",
        "chained to his house, Izzie was tied to the wall at a safe distance\n",
        "from him, and they proceeded to make the day hideous for the whole\n",
        "neighborhood.\n",
        "\n",
        "Morris remained at home to greet his mother, received her encomiums,\n",
        "cooked the dinner, and set out for afternoon school with a heavy heart\n",
        "and a heavier conscience. Nothing had occurred in those first hours to\n",
        "show any change in Mrs. Mowgelewsky's opinion of home pets; rather she\n",
        "seemed, in contrast to the mild and sympathetic Miss Bailey, more than\n",
        "ever dictatorial and dogmatic.\n",
        "\n",
        "At a quarter after three, the gold fish having received perfunctory\n",
        "attention, and the Board of Monitors being left again to do their\n",
        "worst, unguarded, Morris and Teacher set out to prepare Mrs.\n",
        "Mowgelewsky's mind for the adoption of Izzie. They found it very\n",
        "difficult. Mrs. Mowgelewsky, restored of vision, was so hospitable, so\n",
        "festive in her elephantine manner, so loquacious and so\n",
        "self-congratulatory, that it was difficult to insert even the tiniest\n",
        "conversational wedge into the structure of her monologue.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally Miss Bailey managed to catch her attention upon financial\n",

        "Morris has managed so beautifully that he has not used it all, and has\n",
        "five cents to return to you. He's a very wonderful little boy, Mrs.\n",

        "\n",
        "\"Well,\" said Miss Bailey, \"he wasn't always alone.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No?\" queried the matron with a divided attention. She was looking for\n",
        "her purse, in which she wished to stow Morris's surplus.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"No,\" said Teacher; \"I was here once or twice. And then a little friend\n",

        "\n",
        "Miss Bailey began a purposely vague reply, but Mrs. Mowgelewsky was not\n",
        "listening to her. She had searched the pockets of the gown she wore,\n",
        "then various other hiding-places in the region of its waist line, then\n",
        "a large bag of mattress covering which she wore under her skirt. Ever\n",
        "hurriedly and more hurriedly she repeated this performance two or three\n",
        "times, and then proceeded to shake and wring the out-door clothing\n",
        "which she had worn that morning.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Gott!\" she broke out at last, \"mine Gott! mine Gott! it don't stands.\"\n",
        "And she began to peer about the floor with eyes not yet quite adjusted.\n",
        "Morris easily recognized the symptoms.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"She's lost her pocket-book,\" he told Miss Bailey.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Yes, I lost it,\" wailed Mrs. Mowgelewsky, and then the whole party\n",
        "participated in the search. Over and under the furniture, the carpets,\n",
        "the bed, the stove, over and under everything in the apartment went\n",
        "Mrs. Mowgelewsky and Morris. All the joy of home-coming and of\n",
        "well-being was darkened and blotted out by this new calamity. And Mrs.\n",
        "Mowgelewsky beat her breast and tore her hair, and Constance Bailey\n",
        "almost wept in sympathy. But the pocket-book was gone, absolutely gone,\n",
        "though Mrs. Mowgelewsky called Heaven and earth to witness that she had\n",
        "had it in her hand when she came in.\n",
        "\n",
        "Another month's rent was due; the money to pay it was in the\n",
        "pocket-book. Mr. Mowgelewsky had visited his wife on Sunday, and had\n",
        "given her all his earnings as some salve to the pain of her eyes.\n",
        "Eviction, starvation, every kind of terror and disaster were thrown\n",
        "into Mrs. Mowgelewsky's wailing, and Morris proved an able second to\n",
        "his mother.\n",
        "\n",
        "Miss Bailey was doing frantic bookkeeping in her charitable mind, and\n",
        "was wondering how much of the loss she might replace. She was about to\n",
        "suggest as a last resort that a search should be made of the dark and\n",
        "crannied stairs, where a purse, if the Fates were very, very kind,\n",
        "might lie undiscovered for hours, when a dull scratching made itself\n",
        "heard through the general lamentation. It came from a point far down on\n",
        "the panel of the door, and the same horrible conviction seized upon\n",
        "Morris and upon Miss Bailey at the same moment.\n",
        "\n",
        "Mrs. Mowgelewsky in her frantic round had approached the door for the\n",
        "one-hundredth time, and with eyes and mind far removed from what she\n",
        "was doing, she turned the handle. And entered Izzie, beautifully erect\n",
        "upon his hind legs, with a yard or two of rope trailing behind him, and\n",
        "a pocket-book fast in his teeth.\n",
        "\n",
        "Blank, pure surprise took Mrs. Mowgelewsky for its own. She staggered\n",
        "back into a chair, fortunately of heavy architecture, and stared at the\n",
        "apparition before her. Izzie came daintily in, sniffed at Morris,\n",
        "sniffed at Miss Bailey, sniffed at Mrs. Mowgelewsky's ample skirts,\n",
        "identified her as the owner of the pocket-book, laid it at her feet,\n",
        "and extended a paw to be shaken.\n",
        "\n",
        "\"Mine Gott!\" said Mrs. Mowgelewsky, \"what for a dog iss that?\" She\n",
        "counted her wealth, shook Izzie's paw, and then stooped forward,\n",
        "gathered him into her large embrace, and cried like a baby. \"Mine Gott!\n",
        "Mine Gott!\" she wailed again, and although she spent five minutes in\n",
        "apparent effort to evolve another and more suitable remark, her\n",
        "research met with no greater success than the addition:\n",

        "Miss Bailey had been sent to an eminently good college, and had been\n",
        "instructed long and hard in psychology, so that she knew the\n",
        "psychologic moment when she met it. She now arose with congratulations\n",
        "and farewells. Mrs. Mowgelewsky arose also with Izzie still in her\n",
        "arms. She lavished endearments upon him and caresses upon his short\n",

        "gentle, and very intelligent. He can live in the yard with Rover.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Morris turned his large eyes from one to another of his rulers, and\n",
        "Izzie, also good at psychologic moments, stretched out a pointed pink\n",
        "tongue and licked Mrs. Mowgelewsky's cheek. \"This dog,\" said that lady\n",
